 * explicit query gets no stopwords and no minimum length. What it does do is split on whitespace,
 * the separators models slip in (commas, semicolons), and the member delimiters themselves — a query
 * written `Class::member` (or `Class.member`) becomes two sub-queries, `Class` and `member`, the
 * same way the codegraph CLI's `query` treats them, so a query written in the model's notation finds
 * a declaration the index recorded in its own. It also drops a word the same query already carried
 * in another casing, since the index search is case-insensitive and a duplicate would only spend a
 * query budget twice on the same match set.
 * @param query - the raw query text.
 * @param maxTerms - the largest number of terms to return, in the order the model wrote them.
 * @returns the search terms; a single-word query without member delimiters returns that one term,
 * which is the call shape a single-word query used to take, so single-word behaviour is unchanged.
